        Welcome to my small personal corner of the internet. Versions of this site have existed since as far back as <a href="/wmo99/">1998</a>,
        and at this bespoke domain since way back in ought two. Most likely you are interested in one of <a href="http://blog.worldmaker.net/work/">my stories</a>,
        but maybe you are more interested in the <a href="http://github.com/WorldMaker/">open source code that I write</a>, or possibly want to otherwise
        explore the crater-filled decades of <a href="http://blog.worldmaker.net/">ramblings on my blog</a>. Whatever you are looking
        for, I hope you find it, and if you aren't looking for anything specific, I hope you can find something you didn't expect
        that maybe entertains you for a bit.
    </p>
