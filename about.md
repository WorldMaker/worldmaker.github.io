This blog is now synthesized by the two-faced [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com)
in [his most common laboratory](http://pages.github.com).

The current design is *dancingboots 2015* once based upon
[fluidity.com](http://www.oswd.org/design/preview/id/2540) by
[drd](http://www.oswd.org/user/profile/id/6369), largely rewritten by me
as a subtle customization of [Bootstrap 3.0](http://getbootstrap.com)
via [Bootswatch](http://bootswatch.com). It uses the
[Tango](http://tango.freedesktop.org/Tango_Icon_Theme_Guidelines) color
palette as a reference palette and is compiled with Less. Font families
for modern browsers are hosted by Google Web Fonts and include [Exo
2](http://ndiscovered.com/exo-2/).
