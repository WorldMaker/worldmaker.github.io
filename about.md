This blog is now synthesized by the two-faced [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com)
in [his most common laboratory](http://pages.github.com).

The current design is *LCARS Moderne (2016)* based primarily on *Star Trek: The Next Generation*,
my own 1999 site design, and modern ideas of my own. It uses [Bulma](http://bulma.io) as a base
CSS library. It uses the [LCARS Developer](http://lcarsdeveloper.com) palettes and the
[Tango](http://tango.freedesktop.org/Tango_Icon_Theme_Guidelines) color
palette as reference palettes and is compiled with Sass. Font families
for modern browsers are hosted by Google Web Fonts and include [Exo
2](http://ndiscovered.com/exo-2/).
